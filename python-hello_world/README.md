This project is an introduction to Python programming. It focuses on Python basics, script execution, string manipulation and coding style.

## TASKS

### 0. Hello, print
>Write a Python script that prints exactly *"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle*, followed by a new line.  

File: 2-print.py

### 1. Print integer
> Complete [this source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/main/3-print_number.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.  
    -The output of the script should be:
        the number, followed by **Battery street**,  
        followed by a new line  
    -You are not allowed to cast the variable **number** into a string  
    -Your code must be *3 lines long*  
    -You have to use *f-strings*  

File: 3-print_number.py

### 2. Print Float
> Complete [the source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/main/4-print_float.py) in order to print the float stored in the variable **number** with a precision of 2 digits.
    The output of the program should be:  
        -*Float:* followed by the float with only 2 digits  
        followed by a new line  
    -You are not allowed to cast **number** to string  
    -You have to use *f-strings*

File:  4-print_float.py

### 3. Print String
> Complete [this source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/main/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable **str**, followed by its first 9 characters.  
    The output of the program should be:  
        -*3* times the value of **str**  
        followed by a new line  
        -followed by the 9 first characters of **str**  
        -followed by a new line  
    -You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement  
    -Your program should be **maximum** *5 lines long*

File: 5-print_string.py

### 4. Play with strings
> Complete [this source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/main/6-concat.py) to print *Welcome to Holberton School!*    
    -You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.  
    -You have to use the variables **str1** and **str2** in your new line of code  
    -Your program should be exactly *5 lines long* 

File: 6-concat.py

### 5. Copy - Cut - Paste
> Complete [this source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/main/7-edges.py)  
    -You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements  
    -Your program should be exactly *8 lines long*  
    -**word_first_3** should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word  
    -**word_last_2** should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word  
    -**middle_word** should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

File: 7-edges.py

### 6. Create a new sentence
> Complete [this source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/main/8-concat_edges.py) to print **object-oriented programming with Python**, followed by a new line.  
    -You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements  
    -Your program should be exactly *5 lines long * 
    -You are not allowed to create new variables  
    -You are not allowed to use string literals

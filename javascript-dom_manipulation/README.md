# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

## Description

This project focuses on learning how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. It covers selecting and modifying HTML elements, handling events, making network requests, and more. By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with essential JavaScript techniques for dynamic web development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Select HTML elements in JavaScript.
- Understand differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors.
- Modify an HTML element's style and content.
- Update and manipulate the DOM.
- Make network requests using `XmlHTTPRequest` and `Fetch API`.
- Bind and listen to DOM events.
- Handle user interactions effectively.

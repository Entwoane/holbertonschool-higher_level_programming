### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable **number** each time it is executed. Complete [the source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x01.py/blob/main/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable **number** is positive or negative.  

- The variable **number** will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You donâ€™t have to understand what *import*, *random. *randint* do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
  - The number, followed by
    - if the number is greater than 0: **is positive**
    - if the number is 0: **is zero**
    - if the number is less than 0: **is negative**  
  - followed by a new line

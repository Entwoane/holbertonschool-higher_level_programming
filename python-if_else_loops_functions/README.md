# Python - if/else, loops, functions

Introduction to if, if...else statements, while and for loops and functions

## TASKS

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable **number** each time it is executed. Complete [the source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x01.py/blob/main/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable **number** is positive or negative.  

- The variable **number** will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what *import*, *random. *randint* do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
  - The number, followed by
    - if the number is greater than 0: **is positive**
    - if the number is 0: **is zero**
    - if the number is less than 0: **is negative**  
  - followed by a new line

### 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete [the source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x01.py/blob/main/1-last_digit_py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

- The variable **number** will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what *import, random.randint* do. **Please do not touch this code**. This line should not change: ***number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)***
- The output of the program should be:
  - The string **Last digit of**, followed by
  - the number, followed by  
  - the string **is**, followed by the last digit of **number**, followed by  
    - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string **and is greater than 5**
    - if the last digit is 0: the string **and is 0**
    - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string **and is less than 6 and not 0**
  - followed by a new line

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

- Use only one **print** function with string format
- Use only one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

File: [2-print_alphabet.py](https://github.com/Entwoane/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-if_else_loops_functions/2-print_alphabet.py)


### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.  

- Print all the letters except **q** and **e**
- You can only use one *print* function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module
